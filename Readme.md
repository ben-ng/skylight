## Core Values

Real-time collections are difficult to do well unless you have your priorities set straight.

In order of importance, here are the goals of Skylight:

1. Correctness

  Skylight is a thin but bulletproof interface you between your database and client.

2. Simplicity

  Simplicity allows consumers of Skylight to create understandable and well behaved collections.

3. Performance

  Without compromising on correctness or simplicity, Skylight is *fast*.
